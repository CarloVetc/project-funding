# DEVELOPMENT TEAM VOTING  
Ethereum<sup>Classic</sup> Voting Proposal. ECVPs propose and describe projects requesting funding which has been freely donated to any Ethereum<sup>Classic</sup> donation account.

It should firstly be stated that we believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted - by anyone.

As systems grow, it becomes necessary to acquire funding to accommodate platform maintenance, development, and improvement without being beholden to a central foundation. Being unlikely, or at the very least unwise, that any party wishing to contribute would randomly give any sum of money to an anonymous pirate; it is necessary to form a committee to maintain the escrow. 
The ethereum<sup>classic</sup> platform smart contract offers us a system to establish such a group.
Under no circumstance will this document be used as a basis for governance of the EthereumClassic platform as a whole. The committee should me as functionally small as possible while including a diverse voting body.    

# Proposals
Any person, organization, smart contract, or any similarly situated representative capable of meeting the cryptographic verifications put forth in this document; without any limitation implied due to age, gender, race, nationality or religion shall be allowed to make proposals. Proposals should be evaluated based on necessity, platform benefit, and the proposerâ€™s competence. A system will be established at a later time to easily facilitate this operation and allow for transparency in the process.
